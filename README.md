# html-lstm
The aim of this project is to create a LSTM recurrent neural network that can learn to generate webpages consisting of HTML and CSS. 
The network is trained on a text file with HTML and CSS that has been taken from random urls. The pages to which the urls lead did not or hardly use any JavaScript.

### Future directions
Ideally this project could be used towards the higher goal of generating personalised web pages. So for example, a specific website will look differently depending on which user is accessing it and what her/his web preferences are.
